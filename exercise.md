Smart-contract engineer assignment - Follow-up
Introduction
Welcome back!

This follow-up exercise is designed to assess your technical growth since our previous evaluation.

Exercise - Blind Vault Attack 2.0
The objective of this exercise is to find a way to empty a deployed vault on the Sepolia Optimism network without the code of the contract or any ABI.

This exercise will be considered complete if the contract at address 0xEF8433eC69ACc8B58522cDbbB899172ae62af4AC is entirely emptied, and your script is committed here.

To assist you, the contract was deployed via this transaction. You may use any tools at your disposal to find a way to break-in incognito.

Deliverables
Please provide:

Working exploit script that successfully drains the contract.
Detailed explanation of your methodology.
